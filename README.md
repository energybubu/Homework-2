> Path: tokenB -> tokenA -> tokenD -> tokenC -> tokenB
>
> 5.0000 tokenB  ->  5.6553 tokenA
> 5.6553 tokenA  ->  2.4588 tokenD
> 2.4588 tokenD  ->  5.0889 tokenC
> 5.0889 tokenC  ->  20.1299 tokenB
>
> Final Reward: 20.1299 tokenB

## Problem 2
What is slippage in AMM, and how does Uniswap V2 address this issue? Please illustrate with a function as an example.

> Solution

## Problem 3
Please examine the mint function in the UniswapV2Pair contract. Upon initial liquidity minting, a minimum liquidity is subtracted. What is the rationale behind this design?

> Solution
